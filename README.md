# Trackio
## 🚀 Project Description

Trackio is a collaborative learning platform that helps people grow together through healthy competition, progress tracking, and shared resources. Users can create or join groups around a specific skill, complete subtopics from a shared to-do list, and compete on leaderboards. With AI-powered contests, resource sharing, and engaging features, Trackio makes learning structured, social, and motivating.

## 📝 Problem Statement

Learning new skills alone can feel unstructured, isolating, and demotivating. Existing platforms either focus only on courses or only on community, leaving learners without a system that combines progress tracking, collaboration, and gamified competition.

## 💡 Proposed Solution

Trackio creates a space where people can learn together in focused groups, track their progress, and keep motivated through leaderboards and friendly contests. Study materials are shared in one place, and AI-generated quizzes make learning interactive and fun. By blending accountability, collaboration, and gamification, Trackio turns skill-building into a share d journey instead of a solo struggle.
